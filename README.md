# Stock-Prediction-App (Under Construction)
Stock Prediction App (Python + Streamlit) - Small app that correlates money supply metrics w/ US stock indexes
This is a personal project that tries to find a correlation between the three 
main money supply indicators namely M1, M2 and M3 published by The Federal Reserve.
These are the tickers used: Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK-B)","S&P 500 (^GSPC)", "NASDAQ Composite (^IXIC)",
"Russell 2000 (^RUT).

## Getting Started
I would recommend to update ALL imports, just in case there is something outdated. In my case I got several error messages and solved them by updating several libraries.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.8 is fine, even though I used Python 3.10.

npm
npm install npm@latest -g
